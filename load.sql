Consider asking the interviewer to split some of the costs before agreeing to attend. Over at Ask the Headhunter they tackle the question of who foots the bill for a job interview: the applicant or the employer. Usually with entry-level jobs, this isnt an issue. But when recruiters contact you for a very specific skill set, things are different. These employers know you arent local and travel usually comes later in the interview process. First interviews are usually over email or skype these days, so the employer already has a strong interest if you are invited for an out-of-town interview.');
